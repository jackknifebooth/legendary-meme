Everyone needs a little help sometimes, especially when it comes to
assistive technologies. We receive dozens of questions each week from
users asking how to solve problems. Sometimes, people are worried about
asking for help because they feel like they should already know the
answer, but most of the time, you are not the only one who wants to know
how to do something. That’s why, each week we will choose a few of the
best, most common, or simply the most interesting questions we get asked
and share them here along with the answers.

If you need a hand with your assistive tech, whether it is a screen
reader, magnifier, speech to text system, mind mapping tool or anything
else, you can ask the Assistive Tech Agony Aunt for help.

## Letter 1

_Hello,_

_I keep having issues at work where my JAWS crashes. Whenever this_
_happens, I have to manually restart JAWS which I find quite difficult_
_without sighted assistance and sometimes I just have to reset the_
_computer. I was wondering if there was a keystroke to do this?_

_Thanks,_

_Rick_

Hi Rick,

Having to restart JAWS manually can be tricky. There is no inbuilt
keystroke to start JAWS; however, you can set a shortcut key yourself
quite easily to do this by doing the following:

1. Go to your desktop and navigate to the JAWS icon.
2. Press the **Applications Key** or **Shift+F10** to open the context
menu.
3. **Arrow Down** to Properties (**Arrowing Up** is actually quicker
here as the menu loops) and press **Enter** to open the Properties
window.
4. Tab through the fields until you get to the Shortcut Key field. When
in this field, press the key combination you want to use to start JAWS
(we normally suggest **Control+Alt+J** as this doesn’t conflict with any
other standard keystrokes).
5. Press **Enter** to save the changes. At this point, you may get a
message that you require admin privileges to continue. Press **Enter**
on the continue button and if you have the required permissions, the new
shortcut key will be added and you can press it to start JAWS the next
time it crashes.

You can set up a shortcut key in the same way for anything you have on
the desktop. You just have to be careful that the keystroke you choose
doesn't conflict with an existing keystroke (and remember some
keystrokes can be global and others can be application specific).

## Letter 2

_AT Agony Aunt, please help me!_

_My work have done something to the ribbon menus in Outlook and now the_
_keystrokes I used to use to accept meeting invites don't work. How can_
_I accept invites now?_

_Katie_

Hi there Katie,

Unfortunately, without taking a look at your machine, I can't tell you
what the new keystrokes would be, but don't worry, there is actually a
really useful bit of functionality in Microsoft Office 365 which allows
you to search to functions from the ribbon menus (among other things).
The really useful thing about this is that you only have to remember one
keystroke to find anything in the ribbon menus and not long strings of
keystrokes for different actions.

In the meeting invite, press **Alt+Q** to move to the Microsoft Search
field. Here you can type a key word or phrase to search for the
function, so to accept a meeting, type 'accept'. Arrow down through the
search results until you find Accept and press **Enter**. Voila!

This is a great feature which can be used in Outlook, Word, Excel and
other MS Office applications in order to do anything you need from the
ribbon menus.

Enjoy your meetings!
