Whether using it to keep track of your work meetings and tasks to
complete throughout the day, or for personal use to not miss a doctors
appointment or virtual catch up with friends, the Outlook calendar is
one of the most fundamental tools that any of us will use on a daily
basis. Here, we will introduce you to the basic features of the
calendar, including how to navigate, how to create appointments, and how
to reply to meeting invites so that you can get started with the Outlook
calendar with JAWS.

# Basic Navigation {#basic-navigation}
The first step to using the calendar is getting to it. When you open
Outlook from your Start Menu, it will load the email view by default. To
switch to the calendar view, press **Control+2** (you can switch back to
the email view at any time by pressing **Control+1**). When you press
**Control+2** it will switch to the calendar, and put your focus on (or
close to) the current time and day.

Once you are in the calendar, there are 2 ways to navigate: If you use
the **Arrow Keys**, you will move between time slots. The **Up** and
**Down Arrow** will move between 30-minute time slots in the current
day. The **Right** and **Left Arrow** will move from a 30-minute time
slot, to the same time slot on the next (**Right Arrow**) or previous
(**Left Arrow**) day. This kind of navigation is more commonly used when
creating appointments.

The second basic navigation form is to use the **Tab** key to move
between appointments in your calendar. Pressing **Tab** will move to the
next appointment in your calendar. You can move backwards through
appointments by pressing **Shift+Tab**. When an appointment takes focus,
JAWS will announce the key information, such as the title of the
appointment, the start and end times, who created it, and which
appointment it is of the day, e.g. 1 of 3 means it is the first
appointment of three on the current day.

Note, when using Tab to navigate, JAWS will not stop at the last
appointment of the day. Instead, when you press **Tab** on the last
appointment of a day, it will move to the first appointment of the next
day. Similarly, **Shift+Tab** will move to the last appointment of the
previous day when you move past the first appointment of a day.

If you navigate to a different day and want to return to today, simply
press **Control+T** and it will switch to the start of today’s calendar.
Note, if you are not in day view (see below) this will put you at the
start of whatever view you are currently on which may not be today.

# Viewing Appointment Details {#viewing-appointment-details}
When using **Tab** to navigate the calendar, JAWS will announce the key
details of the appointment, but you may want to get more detailed
information such as details the organizer has included. You can easily
do this by navigating to the appointment you want to view using **Tab**,
then pressing **Enter** to open it. When you press **Enter**, it will
open the appointment in a new window which will be called the same thing
as the appointment title with –Appointment or -Meeting at the end
(depending on the type of appointment).

You focus will land in the main body of the appointment details which
the organized has written. You can navigate this with your normal
reading keys to read the text and find any additional information, phone
numbers, or links. Once you have finished reading the details, press
**Escape** to close the appointment window and return to the Outlook
calendar.

# Calendar Views {#calendar-views}
Outlook has the ability to display a single day on the calendar, or
multiple days up to a whole month. You can change the view by pressing
**Alt** and a key on the **number row from 1 to equals**. For example,
**Alt+1** will switch to single day view, **Alt+2** will display 2 days,
**Alt+Minus** will switch to week view and **Alt+Equals** will switch to
month view. You can use whichever view works best for you, but one thing
to bear in mind is that the more days that are displayed at once, the
more appointments there are to display and visually, they often to not
always fit onto the screen and get hidden. As a general rule, we
normally suggest using Day View (**Alt+1**) to make sure the maximum
number of events (usually all of them except in rare circumstances) are
displayed.

# Creating a New Appointment {#creating-a-new-appointment}
Creating appointments in your calendar is an easy way to ensure you
don’t miss anything important in your day. You have two options when
creating an appointment. You can navigate to the day and time you want
to create it on using the arrow keys, or you can simply type the date
and time once you are in the new appointment screen. For now, we will
just go through the later as this tends to be much quicker.

From anywhere in your calendar, press **Control+N** to create a new
appointment. This will open a new window and put your focus in the Title
field. Type the title for your meeting and then **Tab** to the next
field, which is the Start Date. Type the date you want the meeting to
start (Note, you can use dashes, forward slashes, backslashes or full
stops between the day, month, and year) and press **Tab** to move to the
next field. Type the time you want your meeting to start using a 24 hour
clock and then **Tab** to the next field. The End Date will
automatically be set to the same as your Start Date, but you can change
this if you need to in the same way as above. The End Time will be set
to 30 minutes after the Start Time, but again, you can change this as
you need.

As you continue to **Tab** through the fields, you will find an All Day
checkbox. If you have an all day event, such as annual leave, you can
press **Space** to check this rather than set a start and end time. You
will also find a Time Zones checkbox and a Location edit. We won’t cover
these for now to keep things simple. By tabbing, you should then come to
an edit which is just labelled Edit. This is the main body of your
appointment where you can type any details you want to in the same way
as an email or Word document.

Once you have finished completing the appointment details, press
**Alt+S** to save it. The new appointment window will close and put
focus back in your calendar.

# Inviting People to Meetings {#inviting-people-to-meetings}
If you want to create a meeting and invite people to it as well so it
appears in their calendars, the process is exactly the same as above
with one extra step. After pressing **Control+N** to create a new
appointment, you need to change the appointment to include invitee
fields by pressing **Control+Shift+Q**. This will change the appointment
layout so that after your Title field, you will tab to a Required field.
Here you can type a name or email address and select it with Enter just
like when adding recipients to an email.

After the Required field, there is an Option field for optional invitees
which works in the same way. Other than this, the whole process of
creating the appointment is the same as previously described.

# Replying to Meeting Invites {#replying-to-meeting-invites}
If someone invites you to a meeting, you will receive an email invite.
You will need to reply to this so that person knows if you can make the
meeting or not. You can do this via the ribbon menus in the email you
receive. The keystrokes for this tend to be different on different
systems, so instead, we recommend using the Microsoft 365 function
search (assuming you have Office 365). Open the invite and press
**Alt+Q** to move to the search edit. Type Accept, Decline or Tentative,
depending on how you want to reply and then **Arrow Down** through the
functions list to the appropriate reply. You will notice that JAWS will
announce “submenu”. This is because there are multiple ways to reply.
Press the **Right Arrow** to open the submenu and **Arrow Down** to the
way you want to respond, e.g. sending a reply, not sending a reply, and
then press **Enter** to respond.
