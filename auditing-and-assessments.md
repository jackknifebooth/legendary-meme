  Accessibility should be baked into any application from the initial
  design stages to ensure anyone is able to use it. Carrying out audits
  of websites and software applications alike allows us to flag
  potential issues and blockers to accessibility and ensure guarantee
  compliance.

In many cases, the first step to becoming accessible ready is taking
stock of your current situation in order to understand where the
problems lie, how seriously they will affect people, and crucially, how
to remedy them.

Not only will we carry out expert assessments of
websites, and applications (both mobile and desktop), but we will show
you solutions to the problems.

# WCAG Auditing
While in the UK, it is only a legal requirement for public sector bodies
to meet WCAG criteria, it can prove extremely beneficial for any
organisation. In 2020, it was estimated that in the UK the spending
power of disabled people and their households was over Â£270 billion.
Ensuring your website is fully accessible opens your doors to those
potential customers. Our WCAG experts will test your website or mobile
app, either in full or concentrate on particular areas, against the full
set of WCAG criteria and provide you with details on any failures found.
In addition, we provide you with code-level advice on how to remediate
them. On request we can also assist in the production of an
accessibility statement and accessibility road map.

# Digital Assessments
If you have an assistive technology user on staff, whether a new starter
or an existing member of staff, ensuring they have the right tools to be
able to do their job is essential. We can carry out a full digital
assessment of their role and needs then provide you with a report of our
findings including the barriers the user(s) will face, and a set of
recommendations for requirements, digital tools, and applications that
would allow them to work effectively. In the case of applications used
internally which are not accessible, we can also provide scripting work
to make these accessible.
