  When assistive technology users are faced with an application that is
  not accessible, it can mean they are unable to perform their role at
  all. We specialise in providing scripting solutions for assistive
  technologies to make applications both accessible and efficient to
  use.

It is a sad reality that assistive technologies do not work effectively
(or at all in some cases) out of the box with all websites and
applications, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t be made to work.

By scripting assistive technologies to work with your applications, you
can be giving a person with a disability the opportunity to show their
true potential.

# Scripting Assessments
If you have a new or existing application you wish to make accessible,
we can create a custom scripted solution which would resolve any
accessibility and usability issues. Then help train the user(s) to make
using the application as efficient as possible for them. The process
will start with a full accessibility assessment of the application(s)
and end with training to ensure your user(s) can be independent and
productive.

the following assistive technologies:
