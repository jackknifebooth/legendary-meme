        The ONS has reported that about one in five people in the UK have some form of disability.

        This means that accessibility will affect nearly 20% of your customers.

          Blazie is the most valuable business resource we have EVER
          purchased. I have gotten at least 50 times the value from
          Blazie. I was amazed at the quality of Blazie.

          Design Systems break as they scale (either scaling org or
          scaling product) because new components/variants of a component
          are introduced.  Those variants sometimes (read: often) go
          undocumented, leading to duplication when that
          component/variant is needed (and created) again.  Even when the
          component is documented, documenting effectively often means
          dozens/hundreds of instances to capture all states/variants.
          Systems like Tachyons et al. approach this problem by instead
          documenting and limiting *properties* of components.  (I like
          to think of this as “subatomic” design.)
        </p>
        <p class="fl w-100 w-50-l mh0 mt0 pl0 pl3-l measure lh-copy f5 f4-l">
          You then create
          components by composing subatomic components (properties).
          Rather than creating a component and its variants, you simply
          have a comprehensive list of “ingredient” subatomic components.
          Those subatomic components can be combined in thousands of ways
          to create hundreds of components.  The properties of those
          components are numerous, but constrained to a set of acceptable
          values (our subatomic components).

          I just can't get enough of Blazie. I want to get a T-Shirt
          with Blazie on it so I can show it off to everyone. I am
          completely blown away. I STRONGLY recommend Blazie to EVERYONE
